This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deployment

The browser always calls the same-origin Next.js `/api/*` gateway. Vercel then
forwards requests to the backend server-to-server, so Railway does not need to
accept browser CORS requests for the frontend to work.

Configure this variable in Vercel for Production, Preview, and Development:

```bash
API_URL=https://your-backend.up.railway.app
```

Do not configure `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` on Vercel. It is not needed and would
expose the Railway URL to browser bundles.

For local development:

```bash
API_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

Railway uploads must use persistent storage or an object-storage service.
Files saved only to the container filesystem can disappear after a restart or
redeploy.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
